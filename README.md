Rather than trying to recreate an art piece, I tried to do a simple Sun-Earth-Moon visual (Such as this one: http://library.thinkquest.org/29033/begin/sunearthtitle.jpg). This is by no means an accurate simulation, aside from the eventual expansion of the sun. It simply has the Sun in the center, illuminating the Earth as it orbits it, as well as the Moon while it orbits the Earth. The camera itself also orbits the system.

A sample video of an earlier version (before the camera moved) can be found here: http://youtu.be/42lHkVU6YHk
